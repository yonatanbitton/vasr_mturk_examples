<p>In the following you are expected to solve an analogy problem.<br>You will be shown three pictures: A, A', B.<br>There is <em>some</em> change going from picture A to picture A'<br> For example, A is a <b><i>dog</b></i> yawning and A' is a <b><i>baby</b></i> yawning - the change is dog → baby.
<p>
<br> 
<p>You need to choose an option out of 4 images.<br>
Choose the image that best solves the analogy<br>
<strong>A is to A' as B is to?</strong></p>
<br> 
<p>We recommend solving the analogies in computer, not mobile phone, as you'll need to see the images in large screen to succeed.</p><br> 

<p>To enter the full task, there will be a qualification test which requires a score of 100% for solving 10 analogies, retake every 24 hours.</p>
<p>For additional (interactive!) examples, you may refer to the project website <a href="https://vasr-dataset.github.io/">vasr-dataset.github.io</a>. <br>Specifically, in the <a href="https://vasr-dataset.github.io/explore">Explore Page</a> you can learn on the different anlogies in the dataset, and in the <a href="https://vasr-dataset.github.io/test">Test Page</a> you can test yourself on 5 analogies, receiving a score.</p>
<br> 

<p>To solve it, understand what is the <strong>key difference</strong> between A and A', and map it to B.</p>
<p>It's possible to have several differences between A and A'. Search for the difference that allows you to choose a candidate that solves the analogy.</p>
<p>The difference between the images is one of the <b>roles</b> in the image: <br>(1) who is the <b>agent</b> in the image (man, horse, car, motorcycle, etc); <br>(2) the <b>verb</b> or the activity the agent is doing (e.g.,: a man <b>nailing</b> a nail); <br>(3) the <b>tool</b> the agent is using (e.g., a man nailing a nail with a <b>hammer</b>); <br>(4) the <b>item</b> that is effected by the agent (e.g., a man nailing a <b>nail</b>).</p>
